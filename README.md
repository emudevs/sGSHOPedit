# sGSHOPedit
(Perfect World) sGSHOPedit

this is a branch of sGSHOPedit from pwtools for working with version 1.4.2 or above thx to loko, souris, rbb for help for those of you who playing around with 1.4.4 client/server, would be nice if you give it a try for boutique (gshop.data) and event boutique (gshop1.data) and post errors/bugs here

[UPDATED]
+ added support for server/client

#Quick Start Tutorial

sGSHOPedit now uses it's own database file which contains all informations (client and server files complement each other, so they are a inconsistent base for editing...)

#Create a new Database

*start sGSHOPedit

import an existing gshop.data (1.4.4 client preferred)

save the file to gshop.db or a name of your choice


#Load & Edit a Database

*start sGSHOPedit
load your database file (i.e. gshop.db)
edit the categories and entries like in the old version


#Export a Database

*start sGSHOPedit
load your database file (i.e. gshop.db)
export one client 1.4.4 file
export one server 1.4.4 file
put the client file into your client and the server file on your server
